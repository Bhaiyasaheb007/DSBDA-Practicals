Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to provide a hands-on learning experience for Data Science and Big Data Analytics. The practical exercises are designed to reinforce concepts and techniques covered in lectures or tutorials. Each exercise includes a detailed set of instructions along with sample code that can be used as a starting point.
Prerequisites

To successfully complete the practical exercises, you should have the following prerequisites:

    Basic understanding of programming concepts (preferably Python or R)
    Familiarity with data analysis and statistical concepts
    Knowledge of machine learning algorithms and techniques
    Understanding of big data concepts and tools (e.g., Hadoop, Spark)

Installation

To get started with the practical exercises, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-science-practicals.git

    Install the required dependencies. Each practical exercise may have its own set of dependencies, which will be mentioned in the respective README file of that exercise.

    Set up the necessary environment or virtual environment to isolate the dependencies for each exercise. Again, instructions for setting up the environment will be provided in each exercise's README file.

Usage

Each practical exercise is organized in its own folder with a dedicated README file. To get started with a specific exercise, navigate to the corresponding folder and follow the instructions provided in the README file. The README file will typically include the following sections:

    Objective: A brief description of the exercise's objective and what you are expected to achieve.
    Dataset: Details about the dataset(s) used in the exercise, including where to obtain them and how to load them into your environment.
    Instructions: Step-by-step instructions on how to approach the exercise, including any code templates or starter code provided.
    Additional Resources: Optional additional resources, such as articles, tutorials, or documentation, that can help you better understand the concepts or techniques used in the exercise.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different approaches, and extend the exercises based on your learning objectives. You can also create your own exercises and contribute them to the repository.
